# 3D World Generator

This Unity3D project generates a 3D enviroment based on Voronoi Diagrams. The user can set parameters such as:
- Map size
- Number of height macro-areas
- Number of detailed areas
- Noise to be added to the diagrams
- Maximum height of the generated terrain

The resulting height map and color texture are also exported as PNG files, which can be used in other softwares to import the generated enviroment.

This project was done with Unity 2019.3.0.f1. Additional information on how the system works can be found in the file Report.pdf
